        <h1>Personas/Storyboarding - The Conveyor Toaster</h1>

            <h6>Sketched above is a commercial conveyor toaster. It is trying to optimize the 
                process of many users needing to toast items simultaneously. The user places a 
                toastable item on the belt and it falls to the tray below when 
                it is ready to be retrieved by the user. There are 3 dials, which
                control the speed of the belt, top heat, and bottom heat of the toaster.
            </h6>
        <h2>User Observations</h2>
            <h4>Key Observations</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Many users put their items through the toaster multiple times</li>
                    <li>Many users line up in a crowded clump to use the toaster—some users appeared happy and chatted with friends, while others appeared stressed and in a rush, likely to their  approaching 9 am classes </li>
                    <li>Most users put their item in, walked away and came back minutes later to retrieve their toasted item  </li>
                    <li>Throughout my observations, only a few users changed the settings on the toaster, even when putting an assorted  variety of bread, bagels, and English muffins through, which each have different settings marked on the toaster's knobs </li>
                    <li>When a user changed the settings, only speed was changed, not top or bottom heat</li>
                    <li>A few users burnt their item and started over and a few fed their item through the toaster a second time after dissatisfied with the toasted level, but most users collected their toasted item from the tray and left the area</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Interview Questions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>What features of the toaster do you notice first?</li>
                    <li>Did anything surprise you during your toasting experience?</li>
                    <li>What difficulties did you encounter while toasting?</li>
                    <li>How often do you use this toaster? </li>
                    <li>When would you use each of the 3 dials?</li>
                    <li>On a scale of 1-10 how pleased with your toasted item are you after use of the toaster?</li>
                    <li>Given the current settings  of the machine, how toasted would you expect your item to be on a scale of 1-10 (1 being untoasted 10 being scorched? After the toast, did that number match the true toasted level of your item?</li>
                </ol>
            <h4>Interview Summary</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>All of my interviewees were regular users of this toaster who used the toaster almost every morning, in a similar fashion every day</li>
                    <li>Each of my interviewees had different habits in relation to the toaster’s settings—one self adjusts the conveyor speed every morning, one intentionally does not alter the settings, and one did not know that the settings existed until he saw a friend change them today</li>
                    <li>Two of my interviewees were extremely satisfied with the toasted-level of their items and one was extremely dissatisfied, since his bagel burnt</li>
                    <li>Interviewees had many grievances with the machine, specifically that their bagels often get stuck when they do not cut them perfectly down the middle, that people change the settings while their item is being toaster, and that you can’t consistently rely on the toaster giving the same result every day </li>
                </ol>  
        <h2>Personas</h2>

                <h6>Soccer Sadie doesn’t know how to use the controls on the toaster and therefore doesn’t end up satisfied with her bagel. She represents a regular user of the toaster amidst busy mornings who has never understood or even noticed the toaster functionality.</h6>
                <h6>Mellow Morning Manny does not have many problems with the interface, and when he encounters dissatisfacction with his toasting, he has the time to re-toast or start over. He represents a regular user of the toaster who has an understanding of the toaster functionality and utilizes it to improve his toasting experience. </h6>
